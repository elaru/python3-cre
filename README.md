custom regular expressions
==========================

I started writing this module during my first semester. Back then I wanted to
extend regular expressions to be expose all matches of a capturing group,
instead of just the last match.

I have since learned a lot about parsers, formal grammars, and why [regular
expressions][1] and [backtracking][2] are not appropriate to construct a syntax
tree. Now this repository only exists to document my history. :-)
