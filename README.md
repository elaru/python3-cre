custom regular expressions
==========================

I started writing this module during my first semester of university. Back then
I wanted to extend regular expressions to expose all matches of a capturing
group, instead of just the last match.

I have since learned a lot about parsers, formal grammars, and why [regular
expressions][1] and [backtracking][2] are not appropriate to construct a syntax
tree. Now this repository only exists to document my personal history. :-)
