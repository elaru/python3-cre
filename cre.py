"""cre - custom regular expressions

This module provides a custom regex implementation I wrote to get a
better understanding of regular expressions. It aims to support the
full feature set of pythons builtin re module excluding unicode
support in character groups (e.g. "\w" will not match the japanese
alphabet). It is not optimized for speed and should not be used in
production code.
If you want to see how the module works, read the docstrings of the
Expression and Parser classes.

        Here, the expression "a+?" is evaluated first and consumes the

        failed. Then we retry the second last expression and start
        reevaluating the last one, and so on.
        Look at the following table; the ranges address the indices in
        the subject:

        iteration | "a+?" | "a{1,3}" | "b"
            #0        -         -       -
            #1        0         -       -

            #3        0       1 - 2     -
            #4        0         1       -
            #5      0 - 1       -       -
            #6      0 - 1     2 - 4     -

        The default behaviour to retry an expression is to simply free
        the last repetition and check whether the new repetition count
        is still within _min_repetitions and _max_repetitions. However,
        for group expressions we take another approach first.

        At first we check whether there is another valid combination of
        child matches with the same amount of repetitions. This is done
        by reevaluating all children, beginning with the last child and
        proceeding backwards.
        The retry method automatically reverts all state on a failing,
        so if a child can't retry, it reassigns its consumed part of the
        subject to the context so the next child can use it for its turn
        on retry again.
        Once a child successfully reevaluates, we walk the child list
        back up and call matches() on each. If this fails again,
        we repeat the previous step. This way iterate the children up
        and down until we find a new valid match combination or the
        first child in the group can't retry anymore, which indicates
        that we have tried every combination.
        Remember that retry() reverts the expression on failure, which
        means once the algorithm can't find another combination, the
        repetition is already completely reversed. All that needs to be
        done now is to pop the last repetition from the group
        expression.
        This behaviour is encapsulated in the internal function
        __retry_one_child(child).

        But! We're not done yet. The last paragraph just described our
        approach for a single repetition. To find all combinations of
        this group expression, we also need to take previous repetitions
        into account.
        Luckily, __match_one_child showed us how to do that: We iterate
        the repetition list up and down and call __match_one_child on
        each until we find another combination.
        To iterate backwards we call __match_one_child. If it returns
        False, we pop the last repetition from the group expression and
        just call it again. If it returns True, we call _matches_once
        on self to iterate forwards.
        This behaviour is encapsulated in the internal function
        __retry_one_repetition().

        Only if these steps fails we free the last repetition.
